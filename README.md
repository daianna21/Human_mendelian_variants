# Human_mendelian_variants
Repository for Human Genomics project.

## Description
This project aimed to calculate the percentage of pathogenic variants associated with human mendelian disorders that are located within exonic, intronic, coding, non-coding, genic and intergenic regions. It used OMIM data of genes associated with such diseases and Ensembl API REST to retrieve the variants within the regions each gene comprises. 

## Motivation
Frequently, mendelian disorders are thought to be caused by exonic or codificant variants, thus, this work pretended to confirm or rebut such intuitions.
